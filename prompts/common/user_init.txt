## TASK: Generate Initial Algorithm

You are tasked with designing a novel heuristic algorithm from scratch. This is the initial design phase where you will create the foundation for the evolutionary algorithm development process.

### REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION
Below is a baseline implementation to illustrate the expected code structure and format:
