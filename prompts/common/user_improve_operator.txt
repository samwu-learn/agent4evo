## TASK: Improve Operator {operator_id}

This operator has shown **{performance_status}** over the last {history_length} generations.

### CURRENT OPERATOR DESCRIPTION
```
{current_description}
```

### PERFORMANCE HISTORY
{performance_history}

### POPULATION CONTEXT
{population_context}

### TOP PERFORMING ALGORITHMS
{top_algorithms}

---

## YOUR ANALYSIS TASK

Based on the performance trend and population characteristics, determine:

1. **Should this be an incremental or radical improvement?**
   - **Incremental**: Small refinement to guide toward better patterns (use when operator shows some success but needs tuning)
   - **Radical**: Complete redesign with new focus (use when operator consistently underperforms or population needs dramatic shift)

2. **What specific guidance should the improved description provide?**
   - For EXPLORATION operators: What new search directions or mechanisms should be explored?
   - For EXPLOITATION operators: What successful patterns should be emphasized or refined?

3. **What should be avoided based on recent failures?**

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide your response as a JSON object in a ```json code block:

```json
{{
  "improvement_type": "incremental" or "radical",
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of why this type of improvement is needed (2-3 sentences)",
  "new_description": "The improved operator description that will guide algorithm generation",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}}
